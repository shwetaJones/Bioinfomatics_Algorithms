# **Genome Path**

**Input:** A sequence path of k-mers Pattern1, … ,Patternn such that the last k - 1 symbols of Patterni are equal to the first k-1 symbols of Patterni+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n-1.
     
**Output:** A string Text of length k+n-1 such that the i-th k-mer in Text is equal to Patterni (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n).
